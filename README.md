An Overwolf Application designed to trigger blendshape expressions over VMC Protocol based off in game events. The application uses overwolf's api to read Kill, death, respawn,
Dragons and Baron events then trigger expressions in VSeeFace. VSeeFace expressions are created with the VSF_SDK so every expression is 100% customizable in unity.
